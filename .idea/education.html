                    I have started my education in the year 2009. I was enrolled into the elementary school Dimo Hadzi Dimov. There I had great teachers that gave
                    me a great foundation for my upcoming studies in life and I met new friends, some of which I still hang out with to this day.
                    In elementary school, I played for the school volleyball team and I competed in math, physics and biology competitions which won me some diplomas.
                    I graduated in 2018 with a 5.00 GPA.

                    Of course, right after elementary school came highschool. I was enrolled in SUGSG Orce Nikolov in the natural-mathematical A program.
                    I put lots of effort into my studies there and I can gladly say that I learned a lot. The teachers gave me great knowledge that I can use further in my
                    studies. Like elementary school, I graduated Orce Nikolov with a 5.00 GPA as well.

                    Currently, I am a student enrolled at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering. I have just finished my first year of studies
                    and it was something that took getting used to in terms of the work environment. The grading system is different since it is no longer highschool
                    and the classes somewhat differentiate. The biggest shock for me was that you are left alone to do what you want and choose whether or not to
                    go to class. Now, I have adapted to the FINKI life and I encourage anyone who is interested in programming and math to enroll here.
