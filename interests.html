                    One of my biggest interests is volleyball. I started playing volleyball when I was 7 years old in the volleyball club FORCA. At first I wasn't
                    very good at it, but I didn't give up. I continued to train and in no time I was a great player. I stayed in FORCA for 5 years and then I went on
                    to play for the volleyball club Rabotnicki. I left there after a year, and I went on to play for my elementary school volleyball team. I played for
                    a year or two and then I stopped. I'm definitely thinking of playing volleyball again in the near future. I miss it very much.

                    Another one of my interests is the universe and astronomy. I have been dreaming about discovering the secrets of the universe ever since I
                    was a little girl. The fact that there are so many other galaxies, planets and stars out there is simply astonishing. I am very much fascinated by it.
                    I hope to visit the International Space Station someday and contribute to its research.

                    We've come to the last part of my interests and that is listening to music and watching TV shows and movies. I think of these two things as forms of art
                    and something that can touch your heart and help you escape reality. Music can actually save your life on so many levels whether or not that is
                    dissatisfaction with the way you look or feel, or you're just going through a tough period in your life. Some of my favorite artists to listen to are The Weeknd, Bon Jovi and Queen. What I love about movies and TV shows is the emotions that the actors
                    put in their roles that really give their character life. Movies can help you understand some parts of life better and on a deeper level. Some of my favorite
                    movies are A Beautiful Mind, Top Gun and Prisoners and Breaking Bad and Outer Banks are some of my favorite TV shows.
